The characterization of dielectric and spectral properties generated by THZ spectroscopy is important to ensure the success of the analysis of biological-origin materials, such as food. Currently, there is a lack of open-source tools to collect and analyze this THZ frequency scan data. The research shows an application in the form of Python code, which shows a user interface containing functionalities of multi-pixel spectroscopy analysis in the two-dimensional space of the images contained in a single multidimensional dataset, the manipulation and application of algorithms for the treatment of THz images and the generation of image sequences, and the evolution of the penetration of THz radiation in video. These functionalities allow researchers to easily identify properties and features in samples through a low-cost application.

## Features

- Import THz images.
- Analyze and get spectroscopy data from THz images.
- Create videos from THz radiation material penetration.
- Get samples measurements results.
- Export images and data results.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/4c1dhydr4/thz.git
cd thz
pip install -r requirements
python main.py
```
